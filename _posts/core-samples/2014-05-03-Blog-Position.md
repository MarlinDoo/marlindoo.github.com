### Sub-Templates

Sub-templates are exactly templates with the only difference being they
define another "root" layout/template within their YAML Front Matter.
This essentially means a template will render inside of another template.

## Next Steps

Please take a look at [{{ site.categories.api.first.title }}]({{ BASE_PATH }}{{ site.categories.api.first.url }})
or jump right into [Usage]({{ BASE_PATH }}{{ site.categories.usage.first.url }}) if you'd like.
